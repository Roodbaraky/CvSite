  <h2>About</h2>
  <h3>Summary</h3>
  <p>I am a Sport Science graduate with a wealth of experience in hands on, customer-centric roles. Pursuing positions within fitness and technology sectors.<br>
    Within hospitality, I progressed to management in a short time and have honed skills in relations and coordinating teams to delivery outstanding service to guests.<br>
    Supplement to my studies in sports medicine and exercise prescription, I attained manual therapy qualifications and worked with collegiate athletes to manage injuries and maintain performance in season.<br>
    Additionally, I organised and taught at a series of recreational massage workshops within ChillOut society at Edinburgh Uni.<br>
    <br>
    In my spare time, I enjoy strength training and all things fitness, and coding projects like the <a href="volumetracker.html">VolumeTracker</a> web app.
  </p>
  <h3>Personal Training</h3>
  <p>I recently completed the flexi-learner level 3 personal training qualification with PT Academy alongside my fulltime position as a supervisor and am exploring continued development for strength and conditioning and injury rehabilitation.</p>
  <h3>Manual Therapy</h3>
  <p>Practicing several martial arts, powerlifting and olympic weightlifting, I am no stranger to taking time out due to injury and feel as though I am perpetually striving to improve movement and function. While I am a
    huge
    advocate of self-care and injury prevention, it's no secret that we need an extra pair of hands from time to time.</p>
  <p>I first became interested in manual therapy following my own experience with chronic injuries and discovering how hard it is to find the right care and treatment plan to ultimately get back to normal. I realised just how valuable massage
    and
    manual therapy and their practitioners can be to someone who has found themself hurt and wanted to be an integral part of the recovery process for other people like me.</p>
  <p>I currently hold qualifications in Sports Massage and Dry Needling and seek to only practice techniques which have been shown to reduce pain, improve mobility and restore quality of movement.</p>
  <p>I aim to deliver evidence-based treatment and recovery plans that are <strong>practical, realistic and tailored to you</strong>, so that you can get back to normal, get moving and kick ass at everything you do.</p>
