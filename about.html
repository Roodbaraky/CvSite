  <h3>About</h3>
  <p>Practicing several martial arts, powerlifting and olympic weightlifting at an amateur level, I am no stranger to taking time out due to injury and feel as though I am perpetually addressing an injury or imbalance of my own. While I am a huge
    advocate of self-care and injury prevention, it's no secret that we need an extra pair of hands from time to time.</p>
  <p>I first became interested in manual therapy following my own experience with chronic injuries and discovering how hard it is to find the right care and treatment plan to ultimately get back to normal. I realised just how valuable massage and
    manual therapy and their practitioners can be to someone who has found themself hurt and wanted to be an integral part of the recovery process for other people like me.</p>
  <p>I currently hold qualifications in Sports Massage and Dry Needling and seek to only practice techniques which are scientifically proven to reduce pain, improve mobility and quality of movement.</p>
  <p>I aim to deliver evidence-based treatment and recovery plans that are <strong>practical, realistic and tailored to you</strong>, so that you can get back to normal, get moving and kick ass at everything you do.</p>
